            //1. window is an object that represents an open window in a browser.

            //2. event is an action that can be detected by javascript.
            //Sometimes we want to execute a JavaScript when an event
            //occurs, such as when a user clicks a button.

            //3. Internet Explorer doesn't pass event to handler. 
            //Instead you can use window.event object which is being 
            //updated immediately after the event was fired. 
            //So the crossbrowser way to handle events:

            //4. window is an object, event is a property that contains the 
            //last event that took place.

            //5. The followig code means e argument is optional. So if you call the method
            //with no arguments it will use a default value of "window.event"
            e = e || window.event;
            var key = e.keyCode || e.charCode;
            //alert('e.type: ' + e.type + '; key: ' + key);
            return key !== 13;
